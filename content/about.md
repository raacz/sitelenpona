# Who We Are 

The Sitelen Pona Publishers and Typographers Association is a multidisciplinary collective of Sitelen Pona experts.

We’re software developers, community leaders, artists, publishers, typographers, and more.

Using our combined expertise, we organize to promote the development and proliferation of Sitelen Pona within the Toki Pona community and beyond.

# What We Do

Through horizontal consensus decision-making, we prepare living drafts for technical standards. Presently, these standards make it easier for Toki Pona speakers to enjoy Sitelen Pona on their devices. In the future, these standards will enable everyone to read and write Sitelen Pona on their preferred devices and platforms.

We operate as an federally-incorporated not-for-profit registered in Canada. Membership in the Association is subject to the approval of existing members. There are no membership fees. Prospective members are welcome to fill out our application form.
